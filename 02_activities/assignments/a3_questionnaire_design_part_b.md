# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part B)

## Requirements
## 1. Comment on the quality of your sample. Do you expect it to be representative of your target population? Why or why not?

    I think that the quality of my sample is representative of the target population, which is the employees of the tech company with a focus on those in entry or lower-level positions. However, there are outside factors that could decrease the quality of my sample. For example, if the employee lists that are being used to identify respondents are not up to date or include incorrect information, employees who could be important to the survey may be excluded.

Ensuring that employee lists are up to date and include correct information will help to maintain the quality of the sample. 

## 2. Given the class content (error, survey quality, ethics) covered since Part A of the assignment, do you wish to make any changes to your original survey? If so, make a copy of your original survey and make any desired changes. Describe the changes and your reasoning. Provide a link here for submission.

Based on what we covered, there are a few changes that I would make to my original survey. 

One of the first changes that I would make is to include a short disclosure that all responses are anonymous so respondents can feel like they can answer freely. This change can help to avoid measurement bias through respondents not answering truthfully due to fear. 

Another change that I would make would be to include a due date for survey submissions; this change could help to avoid non-response errors. 

Here are the changes that I would make to my survey: 

Disclosure about the anonymity of responses
Due date of the survey

1. What department do you work in?
*I would make this question have a drop-down selection to keep responses consistent and cut down on survey completion time*

2. What is your position at the company? (Ex. Entry, mid-senior, senior, C-suite)

3. On a scale from 1-10, how satisfied are you at this company?
*I would reword this question as it is too vague. Satisfaction could mean different things to certain respondents. Instead of having a singular question, I would have sections with questions focused on various topics such as pay, workload, employee well-being, etc. I could use this information to determine what aspects employees are least and most satisfied with*
*Example Questions: On a scale of 1-10, do you feel that your workload is manageable, Do you feel that your pay is in line with the responsibilities of your role (yes/no), Do you feel that the company supports your mental well-being (yes/no)*

4. On a scale from 1-10, how satisfied are you in your role?
*Similar to the question above, I would have a section on employee recognition or role satisfaction with multiple questions.*

5. From least likely to most likely, how likely are you to consider leaving the company?

6. From the choices below (select all that apply), where do you think the company needs to improve? (Ex. culture, processes, compensation)
*I would remove this question as the different question sections would help to identify which section respondents believe needs to be improved*

7. Please explain why you think the company needs to improve in this/these area(s)
*Similar to the questions above, this question would be removed in favour of sections*

8. On a scale from 1-10, if these areas are improved, would it improve your satisfaction at work?
*I believe that this question limits the respondent's answers too much and does not allow them the freedom to fully answer. I would remove this question from the survey and instead conduct a follow-up survey after changes have been implemented and see if feedback from sections has improved or not.*

9. Please provide any additional feedback you may have


## 3. Could the purpose of your survey have been fulfilled through an observational study? If yes, how? If no, why not?

No, I don't think that this survey could have been fulfilled through an observational study. The point of this survey is to answer specific questions; why is turnover happening and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction? 

Due to the questions that the survey needs to answer, respondents need to be asked direct and specific questions to elicit the answers we are looking for. 


## Why am I doing this assignment?

This assignment supports learning outcomes 1, 2, 3, and 4:
	1.	Develop ability to implement simple probability samples.
	2.	Understand more complicated sampling procedures and the tradeoffs involved.
	3.	Identify and understand sources of error or inaccuracies in data as a result of sampling strategies.
	4.	Develop intuition around survey quality.

## Rubric

-	All required components are present and complete **Complete / Incomplete**
-	Assessment of representativeness is justified based on class content **Complete / Incomplete**
-	Changes to original survey are justified based on class content and best practices for sampling **Complete / Incomplete**
