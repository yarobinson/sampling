# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part A)

## Requirements
Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1.	In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2.	Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3.	Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.


### Scenarios
1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.	You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.


# Your Changes

The number of your chosen topic: `1`

Describe the purpose of your survey:

The purpose of my survey is to determine the cause of the high turnover rate within the company especially within entry and lower-level positions and identify what changes employees need to improve employee satisfaction. 

Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and observational units:

- The target population is all employees within the tech company with a focus on those in entry or lower-level positions. 
- The sampling frame is a list of all employees within the company with information on their positions and departments within the company
- The sampling units are the employees within the company who will be receiving the survey
- The observational units for this survey are the survey responses from each employee, their position within the company (a feature that will let us focus on the responses from entry and lower-level employees) and the changes reported by employees that would improve their satisfaction. 

Your 5-10 question survey:
```
1. What department do you work in? 
2. What is your position at the company? (Ex. Entry, mid-senior, senior, C-suite)
3. On a scale from 1-10, how satisfied are you at this company?
4. On a scale from 1-10, how satisfied are you in your role?
5. From least likely to most likely, how likely are you to consider leaving the company? 
6. From the choices below (select all that apply), where do you think the company needs to improve? (Ex. culture, processes, compensation)
7. Please explain why you think the company needs to improve in this/these area(s)
8. On a scale from 1-10, if these areas are improved, would it improve your satisfaction at work? 
9. Please provide any additional feedback you may have
